Seg id --> uint_t → void * →> add to sequence

### TODO:
* when machine boots, you have seg 0
*when call map occurs, you allocate memory and assiocate with an id, id comes from incrementing a counter or reusing a previously mapped and unmapped segment
* keep track of when map is called and see if there is an umapped segment
